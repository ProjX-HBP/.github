## About

ProjX is a platform for students to build their portfolios through project-based work. Inspired by Fiverr and LinkedIn, companies may contract projects to be completed by prospective students, while students may explore and apply to projects they are interested in. This project was developed by Randy Huang, Tarun Eswar, Erica Dong, and Charles Tang for HackBeanpot 2024 hackathon.

## Current Features

- Project listings dashboard
- Personal profile for each student, project, and company, with personalized company comments on every project
- Student and company side logins to view project listings and application statuses

### Future Work

- AI-based project recommendations based on your major, interests, and feedback from previous projects 

## Contributing

We'd love to have your help in making ProjX better. The project still has work to do before full production launch, but if there's an issue you'd like to see addressed sooner rather than later, feel free to report it in the issues!
